    <!-- Who We Are -->
    <section>
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Your Tradie Support is run by a local Taranaki bloke with experience in logistics, accounts, and admin. I know paperwork is an essential part of any job, but it can be time-consuming, frustrating, and tedious. I’m here to make admin tasks easier by handling:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Invoices</li>
        <li>Quotes</li>
        <li>Marketing tasks</li>
        <li>General administrative work</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This saves tradies time, stress, and hassle so they can focus on their tools and their customers.</p>

    <!-- Our Story -->
    <section>
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>After moving from Auckland to Taranaki in 2021, I now call Stratford home.</p>
      <p>Having bought my first home in 2023, I’ve experienced the ups and downs of homeownership. Seeing different tradies come through to fix multiple issues gave me a real insight into how much effort it takes to run a trade business while keeping customers happy—especially in today’s financial climate.</p>
      <p>With the birth of my daughter in 2024, I also know how precious family time is. That’s why helping tradies with tedious, time-consuming admin can make a real difference—so after a long day on the tools, they can spend more quality time with their loved ones.</p>

    <!-- Why We Do It -->
    <section>
      <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
      <p>Admin and paperwork can feel like a never-ending job. I’ve seen tradies struggle to keep up with invoices, quotes, and marketing while trying to run their business. My goal is simple: take care of the behind-the-scenes tasks so tradies can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus on their trade and their clients</li>
        <li>Reduce stress from paperwork</li>
        <li>Spend more time with family</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s about making life easier for hardworking tradies and helping them maintain a better work-life balance.</p>
