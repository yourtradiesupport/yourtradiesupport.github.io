<!-- FAQ SECTION -->
<section id="faq">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What services do you offer?</h3>
    <p>We provide admin and business support for tradies, including invoicing & follow-ups, quotes, paperwork & filing, job bookings, and general office admin. Marketing support is offered separately if required.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What counts as an admin task?</h3>
    <p>An admin task is one clear, individual action such as creating and sending an invoice (including one standard follow-up), sending a quote, booking a job or appointment, filing or uploading paperwork for a job, or entering job details. Small updates or follow-ups that naturally form part of another task are included. Larger or more complex requests may be broken into multiple tasks or quoted separately.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Does sending an invoice include follow-up?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Creating and sending an invoice includes one standard follow-up if payment has not been received. Any additional follow-ups may count as extra admin tasks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How long does it take to action a request?</h3>
    <p>Most standard admin tasks are completed within one business day. Urgent requests can be prioritised if needed — just let us know.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I send tasks to you?</h3>
    <p>Tasks can be sent via email, text, or Facebook Messenger — whatever works best for you. We’ll confirm once each task has been received and completed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What if my request is bigger than a standard admin task?</h3>
    <p>If a task is more involved than a standard admin task, we’ll let you know before starting and confirm how it will be charged. Larger clean-ups, system setups, or ongoing projects are quoted separately.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you offer monthly support packages?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Monthly task bundles are perfect for tradies who want regular support. Packages are flexible and can be adjusted as your business needs change.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What happens if I don’t use all my monthly tasks?</h3>
    <p>Unused tasks can <strong>roll over once</strong> to the following month. This keeps things fair while giving you flexibility.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you offer urgent or same-day support?</h3>
    <p>Where possible, yes. Urgent or same-day requests depend on workload and availability.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do I need to sign a contract?</h3>
    <p>No. There are no long-term contracts. Services are flexible to suit your business.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Who do you work with?</h3>
    <p>We work with tradies and small businesses, especially sole traders and small teams who want reliable admin support without hiring staff.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">

      <!-- OUR STORY -->
      <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded shadow space-y-4">
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          I’m an Irish-born lad who moved to New Zealand in 2016. After meeting my wife, we relocated from Auckland to Taranaki in 2021 and now call Stratford home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having bought our first home in 2023, we’ve experienced the highs and lows of home ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
          With different tradies coming through our doors fixing multiple issues, I’ve seen firsthand how much hard work and dedication it takes to run a trade business and maintain great customer relationships — especially in the current financial climate.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the birth of our daughter in 2024, I also understand how precious family time is. That’s why helping tradies with tedious and time-consuming admin can make a real difference — so after a hard day on the tools, you can enjoy quality time with your loved ones.
