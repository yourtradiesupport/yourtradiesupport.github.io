<!-- ABOUT & OUR STORY SIDE BY SIDE -->
<section id="about-story" class="side-by-side">
  <div>
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Your Tradie Support is run by a local Taranaki husband-and-wife team with experience in truck driving, logistics, accounts, and admin. We understand how busy tradies are and provide reliable support so you can focus on your work, not paperwork.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>I’m an Irish-born lad who moved to New Zealand in 2016. After meeting my wife, we relocated from Auckland to Taranaki in 2021 and now call Stratford home. Having bought our first home in 2023, we’ve experienced the highs and lows of home ownership. With different tradies coming through our doors fixing multiple issues, I’ve seen firsthand how much hard work and dedication it takes to run a trade business and maintain great customer relationships — especially in the current financial climate. With the birth of our daughter in 2024, I also understand how precious family time is. That’s why helping tradies with tedious and time-consuming admin can make a real difference — so after a hard day on the tools, you can enjoy quality time with your loved ones.</p>

<!-- FAQ SECTION -->
<section id="faq">
  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What services do you offer?</h3>
    <p>We provide admin and business support for tradies, including invoicing & follow-ups, quotes, paperwork & filing, job bookings, and general office admin. Marketing support is offered separately if required.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What counts as an admin task?</h3>
    <p>An admin task is one clear, individual action such as creating and sending an invoice (including one standard follow-up), sending a quote, booking a job or appointment, filing or uploading paperwork for a job, or entering job details. Small updates or follow-ups that naturally form part of another task are included. Larger or more complex requests may be broken into multiple tasks or quoted separately.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Does sending an invoice include follow-up?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Creating and sending an invoice includes one standard follow-up if payment has not been received. Any additional follow-ups may count as extra admin tasks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How long does it take to action a request?</h3>
    <p>Most standard admin tasks are completed within one business day. Urgent requests can be prioritised if needed — just let us know.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>How do I send tasks to you?</h3>
    <p>Tasks can be sent via email, text, or Facebook Messenger — whatever works best for you. We’ll confirm once each task has been received and completed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What if my request is bigger than a standard admin task?</h3>
    <p>If a task is more involved than a standard admin task, we’ll let you know before starting and confirm how it will be charged. Larger clean-ups, system setups, or ongoing projects are quoted separately.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you offer monthly support packages?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Monthly task bundles are perfect for tradies who want regular support. Packages are flexible and can be adjusted as your business needs change.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What happens if I don’t use all my monthly tasks?</h3>
    <p>Unused tasks can <strong>roll over once</strong> to the following month. This keeps things fair while giving you flexibility.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you offer urgent or same-day support?</h3>
    <p>Where possible, yes. Urgent or same-day requests depend on workload and availability.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do I need to sign a contract?</h3>
    <p>No. There are no long-term contracts. Services are flexible to suit your business.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Who do you work with?</h3>
    <p>We work with tradies and small businesses, especially sole traders and small teams who want reliable admin support without hiring staff.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Why choose Your Tradie Support?</h3>
    <p>We’re a local Taranaki husband-and-wife team with experience in truck driving, logistics, accounts, and admin. We focus on making the paperwork side of business easy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What do you need to get started?</h3>
