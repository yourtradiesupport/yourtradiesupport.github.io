    <!-- OUR STORY -->
    <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded shadow">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an Irish-born lad who moved to New Zealand in 2016. After meeting my wife, we relocated from Auckland to Taranaki in 2021 and now call Stratford home.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Having bought our first home in 2023, we’ve experienced the highs and lows of home ownership. With different tradies coming through our doors fixing multiple issues, I’ve seen firsthand how much hard work and dedication it takes to run a trade business and maintain great customer relationships — especially in the current financial climate.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the birth of our daughter in 2024, I also understand how precious family time is. That’s why helping tradies with tedious and time-consuming admin can make a real difference — so after a hard day on the tools, you can enjoy quality time with your loved ones.
